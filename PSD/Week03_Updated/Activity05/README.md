Week 3 – Activity 5
Commercial Clinic Management System

(ER Diagram + SQLite3 OOP Project)

1. Professional Scenario

A modern clinic operates with multiple departments, licensed doctors, registered patients, scheduled appointments, and medical records. Patients may visit the clinic multiple times, consult different doctors, and belong to different age groups. Doctors are employed under specific medical departments (e.g., Ophthalmology, Cardiology) and may handle multiple appointments per day.

The clinic system must:

Maintain patient demographics

Manage doctors and their departments

Track appointments

Store medical visit records

Support administrative analytics such as:

Listing senior patients (age > 65)

Counting ophthalmology doctors

The system is implemented using SQLite3 and Object-Oriented Programming, following third normal form (3NF) and real commercial database practices.
