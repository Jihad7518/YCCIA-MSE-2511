Week 3 – Activity 4: SQLite3 OOP Project
Scenario Description

This project models an academic management system for a postgraduate Master of Software Engineering (MSE) program. The system is designed to manage students, teachers, courses, and enrollments within a college environment. Each student can enroll in multiple courses during a semester, and each course can have multiple students enrolled. This many-to-many relationship between students and courses is handled using an Enrollment entity.

Each course is taught by one teacher, while a teacher may teach multiple courses based on their specialization. The system stores essential academic information such as student details, teacher specialization, course credit values, and the semester of enrollment to reflect a realistic academic structure.

The database allows academic administrators to retrieve meaningful information, such as the total number of students enrolled in a specific course and the names of teachers teaching a particular course. In this project, SQLite3 and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles are used to demonstrate querying the database to display the number of students enrolled in the MSE800 course and to list all teachers who are teaching the MSE801 course.
