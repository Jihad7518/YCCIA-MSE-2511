# Week 3 – Activity 4: SQLite3 OOP Project

## Scenario Description

This project represents a postgraduate academic management system for a college offering Master of Software Engineering (MSE) courses. The system manages students, teachers, and courses, where students are allowed to enroll in multiple courses per semester and teachers may teach more than one course. Similarly, a single course can have multiple students enrolled and may be taught by multiple teachers.

To accurately represent these real-world relationships, the system uses associative entities to manage many-to-many relationships between students and courses, as well as teachers and courses. The database allows academic administrators to retrieve analytical information such as the total number of students enrolled in a specific course and the list of teachers assigned to teach a particular course. This project specifically demonstrates retrieving the number of students enrolled in the MSE800 course and listing all teachers teaching the MSE801 course using SQLite3 and Object-Oriented Programming principles.
