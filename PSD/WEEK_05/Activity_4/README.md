This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented inheritance by modeling a university personnel system.

A base Person class defines common attributes shared by all individuals.

The Student and Staff classes inherit from Person, while General and Academic staff further extend the Staff class.

The design follows real-world hierarchy and clearly illustrates single and multi-level inheritance in Python, with each subclass adding its own specific attributes and behaviors.
