This project demonstrates object-oriented inheritance using an animal classification system.

A base Animal class defines common attributes shared by all animals.

The Mammal, Bird, and Fish classes inherit from Animal, and specific animal types further extend these classes by implementing unique behaviors such as walking, flying, and swimming.

The project clearly illustrates hierarchical and multi-level inheritance in Python.
