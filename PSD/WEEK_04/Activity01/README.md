Scenario Description

A university uses a Smart Library Management System to manage library resources, members, and borrowing activities. Both students and faculty members can search for books, view availability, and track their borrowing history. Librarians are responsible for maintaining book records, issuing and receiving books, and managing member accounts. Library administrators oversee system operations and generate reports for decision-making, such as identifying overdue members and analyzing book usage.

The system allows multiple actors to interact with shared functionalities, reflecting real-world collaboration between users and library staff. This design improves efficiency, transparency, and accountability within the library.
