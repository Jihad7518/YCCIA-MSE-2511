Scenario Description

A university uses a Smart Library Management System to manage library resources, members, and borrowing activities. Library Members, including students and faculty, can search for books, view availability, and track their borrowing history. Librarians are responsible for maintaining book records, issuing and receiving books, and managing member accounts. Library Administrators oversee overall system operations and generate reports to support decision-making, such as identifying overdue members and analyzing book usage trends.

The system enables multiple actors to interact with shared functionalities, reflecting real-world collaboration between library users and staff. This design improves operational efficiency, transparency, and accountability within the university library.
